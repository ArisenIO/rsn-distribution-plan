### Introduction
It is important that the members of a blockchain network's community, as well as those who are affiliated with the network (cryptocurrency exchanges, software development firms, etc.), understand how a blockchain network's cryptographic tokens are distributed. This is to create transparency and to ensure there is no network manipulation capable of taking place by the network's coin holders. For this reason, we have created an official distribution plan, hereinafter referred to as the ```RSN Distribution Plan```, which will detail how all 1,000,000,000.0000 of the RSN initially created at the genesis stage of the Arisen network shall be distributed. Over time, the Arisen network will decentralize itself through air drops, inflation and other means. Below, our plan is split into multiple sections so that it is easy to understand. 

**NOTE:** ***This plan has been accepted by the 21 elected block producers of the network, the Arisen treasury, and is to be considered final.***

### DP.1
(A). Ticker Symbol: RSN

(B). Full Name: ArisenCoin

(C). Amounts In Circulation
There are currently 1,000,000,000 RSN (1 billion RSN), split between the Arisen and BitShares networks. This is explained further in Section DP.1(E). RSN has a max supply of 10,000,000,0000 RSN (10 billion RSN). After the initial supply of 1,000,000,000 RSN, RSN can only be minted through inflation (explained in Section DP.1(D)).

(D). Inflation
Every year, 5% of RSN's total supply is minted through what is known as "inflation". This means, the first year, 50,000,000.0000 RSN will be minted during the inflation process.  Inflation will take place, until the max supply of 10,000,000,000 RSN has been reached.

(E). Tokenized RSN vs. Native RSN
RSN is available on the native Arisen network and in a tokenized format on the BitShares network and will soon be available on EOS, Ethereum and TRON's networks in a tokenized format as well. The tokenized format of RSN is simply a representation of the actual native version. In other words, it's worth the same, considering it can be exchanged directly for native RSN 1:1.

Users of the Arisen network and outside networks will be able to move RSN between networks by using a new dApp known as "aExchange". This will work like so:

IF MOVING RSN FROM BITSHARES TO ARISEN:
- Alice wants to move her RSN on BitShares to her account (@alice) on Arisen.
- Alice goes to aExchange and chooses to move 10 RSN on BitShares to Arisen and lets aExchange know which account on Arisen she wants the 10 RSN to be sent to, in this case - "@alice".
- Alice is given aExchange's BitShares ```@arisenout``` wallet to send 10 RSN to, along with a SHA-256 (random set of letters and numbers) to use as a transaction memo.
- Alice sends 10 RSN to @arisenout on BitShares, with the SHA-256 memo aExchange specifies. 
- aExchange waits until this transaction appears in the @arisenout wallet, with the SHA-256 specified and then BitShares burns that 10 RSN from circulation on the BitShares network.
- aExchange then mints 10 RSN to the ```@out``` account on Arisen  and then sends to the ```@alice``` account on Arisen.
- Alice has moved RSN from BitShares to Arisen.

IF MOVING RSN FROM ARISEN TO BITSHARES:
- Alice wants to move her RSN on Arisen to her BitShares account (@alice-on-bitshares).
- Alice goes to aExchange and chooses to move 10 RSN on Arisen to BitShares and lets aExchange know which account on BitShares she wants the 10 RSN to be sent to, in this case - "@alice-on-bitshares".
- Alice is given aExchange's Arisen account ```@out```, to send 10 RSN to, along with a SHA-256 (random set of letters and numbers) to use as a transaction memo.
- Alice sends 10 RSN to the account @out on Arisen, with the SHA-256 memo aExchange specifies.
- aExchange waits until this transaction appears in the @out account, with the SHA-256 specified and then Arisen burns 10 RSN from circulation on the Arisen network.
- aExchange then mints 10 RSN to the ```@arisenout``` account on BitShares and then sends to the ```@alice-on-bitshares``` account on BitShares.
- Alice has moved RSN from Arisen to BitShares.

By burning coins on one of the networks and then minting them on another, the "total supply" of both networks combined will always stay the same (including inflation).

(F). Current Arisen Holders
Before diving into how ArisenCoin will be distributed, there are several important ArisenCoin holders that you should know about. It's important that the community understands why they were given a large amount of coins and what they're bringing to the community. 

**(S)** = This total includes the 7.5M RSN given to @infibit to stake on the Arisen network as an initial block producer. While these totals are staked, the user has custody of that 7.5M RSN and those 7.5M RSN will grow with interest during that staking period. 

***Notable Holders:***
- @infibit - 17,500,000 RSN (S) - InfiBit is a company/block producer on the network, who originally kick started the development of the third iteration of the Arisen project and completely funded the developers who took part in those efforts. InfiBit is also working hand-in-hand with several cryptocurrency exchange platforms to get RSN placement on at least 2-3 exchanges over the course of the next few months.

- @onecoin - 17,500,000 RSN (S) - OneCoin is another company/block producer on the network who is currently funding a team of 31 developers at the software development firm DevGenesis, who are currently overseeing the development of Arisen's core software as well as the development of Arisen's aVote application, blockchain explorers, developer tools and more. OneCoin is also readying the release of what will become Arisen's new core wallet application, known as "aBank". 

- @peeps - 60,000,000 RSN - Peeps is another company/block producer on the network and by far the biggest contributor to the project thus far. Peeps was given 25,000,000 RSN to sponsor account creation via Arisen's Signup Service (https://signup.arisen.network), as well as another 35,000,000 RSN to pay ```KZART LABS```. KZART LABS is currently building several decentralized applications on the network - like dBnk, dSocial, dPhone and others.

- @dm 22,500,000 RSN (7.5M staked as BP)
- @ml 15,000,000 RSN (7.5M staked as BP)
- @amir 15,000,000 RSN (7.5M staked as BP)
These three guys, who will remain anonymous for now, have supplied a lot of legal support for the network. @dm and @ml are lawyers who are helping out with the many legal needs of the Satoshi Foundation, as well as Arisen's core software development team. They are also assisting with the many legal issues surrounding the placement of RSN on many cryptocurrency exchanges. Being that @dm @amir and @ml are also block producers, they were given 7,500,000 RSN to initially stake on the network (considering Arisen must have 15% of the RSN in circulation staked for block producers to have the ability to produce blocks on the network). @dm, @ml and @amir were given a total of 30,000,000 RSN out of the legal fund and 7,500,000 RSN each as initial block producers. 

- @stan - 22,500,000 RSN
- @michaelx - 15,000,000 RSN
- @lana - 15,000,000 RSN
These three have supported Jared Rice Sr.'s legal fees which allowed for him to launch the Arisen project. Without these three, Rice was without the necessary protection needed or the sanity to do what he has done from where he is currently detained. Stan Larimer, Lana Hull and Michael Taggart provided all of the legal resources required to make sure he returned home in one piece. The 52,500,000 RSN that was split between them (15M for @stan, 15M for @lana and 15M for @michaelx) is a drop in the bucket, compared to what they've done for this project and this community. The amount above also includes the 7.5M given to @stan to stake on the network as an initial block producer.

- Block producers - 150,000,000 RSN (collectively -- 7.5M RSN apiece) - All 21 block producers were given 7,500,000 RSN apiece. These users are defined in Section (VI.). Some of these users also have RSN that will be distributed to them as original contributors, detailed further in Section (IX.).

### I. Original Contributors - 333,250,000 RSN (33.33% of circulation) (@refund)
Original contributors to the AriseBank ICO, as well as those who contributed to the legal fees of Jared Rice Sr., AriseBank and the legal fund for the family of Jared Rice Sr. will be given 4 RSN for every single dollar that was contributed. For this reason, 100,000,000 RSN has been set aside to cover this.

Some original contributors have already received their coins. In total around 109,000,000 RSN has been distributed to original contributors via the BitShares network. The remaining amount of RSN that is undistributed after 12 months, will be placed into the @fund account to fund future Arisen-based projects that the Satoshi Foundation deems necessary, explained in (III.).

We currently have 227,750,000 RSN left in @refund

### II. The Arisen Air Drop - 300,000,000 RSN (30% of circulation) (@air)
The Arisen air drop was recently announced which will take place on April 16th, 2020. You can follow the countdown on the official Arisen website [https://arisen.network](https://arisen.network). Each person who signs up for the air drop will instantly receive 1,000 RSN to their Arisen account. This will enable Arisen to bring on 300,000 new users by the end of the air drop. These 300,000,000 RSN are currently being held in the @atreasury account on the Arisen network and will be distributed from that account on the day it begins.

We currently have 300,000,000 RSN left in @air

### III. Project Funding - 150,000,000 RSN (15% of circulation) (@fund)
We have established a wallet to help fund the development of several applications on the network so that we can motivate others to do the same. The following projects have been given RSN:

- @peeps - 60,000,000 RSN (developers of the dBnk, dPay, dRide, PeerOS, dSocial and dPhone applications).
- @devgenesis - 15,000,000 RSN (developers of Arisen's core software, air drop systems, blockchain explorers and other network-related applications).
- @infibit - 10,000,000 RSN (funding exchange placement for RSN).
- @onecoin - 10,000,000 RSN (funding development of aBank and Arisen's core software).

We currently have 55,000,000 RSN left in @fund that is reserved for those who are contributing to RSN's placement on exchanges, as well as acceptance on various crypto-related platforms.

### IV. Legal - 30,000,000 RSN (3% of circulation) (@legal)
We have set aside a total of 30,000,000 RSN for lawyers and legal fees. Thanks to this legal fund, The Satoshi Foundation has hired a law firm to handle a lot of the immediate legal needs of the network. Those legal fees have been dispersed across three accounts (some have been moved to BitShares):

- @dm - 15,000,000 RSN
- @amir - 7,500,000 RSN
- @ml - 7,500,000 RSN

We currently have 0 RSN left in @legal

### V. Charity Drop - 10,000,000 RSN (1% of circulation) (@charity)
We set aside 10,000,000 RSN for charity, where 10,000,000 RSN was donated to the ventures of eight different people who Jared met throughout his prison journey. RSN will be sent to the following eight users via Arisen's charity fund:

- @aldair-montoya - 2,500,000 RSN
- @rodil-henriquez - 2,500,000 RSN
- @camacho-melendez - 2,500,000 RSN
- @alquimista-farnecio1 - 750,000 RSN
- @frivera - 500,000 RSN
- @md - 500,000 RSN
- @ibarra - 250,000 RSN
- @wilfred - 100,000 RSN

We currently have 400,000 RSN left in @charity

### VI. Block Producers - 157,750,000 RSN (15.77% of circulation)
As stated above in the "Current Holders" section, 150,000,000 RSN (15% of the RSN in circulation) had to be staked on the network for the network to allow for block producers, outside of the genesis user, to verify and sign blocks on the network. The following 21 accounts on the Arisen network were chosen as the initial block producers and were given 7,500,000 RSN apiece, which totaled 157,750,000 RSN, ultimately staking well over the 15% required amount of RSN.

@stan
@onecoin 
@infibit
@bitgirl
@m 
@nefertiti
@marcus
@dbnk
@dpay
@amir 
@dm 
@ml 
@nmh
@dride
@morrison
@jared
@dsocial
@angie
@christy
@drew
@chiraag

While all of these block producers currently have RSN staked on the network, the staked amount as mentioned earlier in this distribution plan, earns interest in BEX, thanks to the new Arisen Computing Marketplace. It's important to understand that staked coins on the network are in-turn resources that can be purchased by others who need to rent space on the network for contract execution. Those who stake their coins on the network never lose them and always maintain custody of their coins. RSN that is staked in return for BEX can be re-exchanged instantly for BEX after the 30 day maturation process, where they will either receive the exact amount of RSN they staked in return or more RSN depending on whether or not that RSN gained interest during the staking period (this all depends on whether or not resources were purchased by other network participants). At any given time, those who started the network can unstake their coins, but this should only take place after others begin staking their coins on the network. It's the duty of these original BPs to keep 15% of the network's coins staked, so that the network continues to run properly.

### VII. Advisors - (1.9% of circulation) - (@advisors)
We have set aside 19,000,000 RSN that will be given to 19 different advisors that will be chosen by leaders of the project, as well as the foundation, whom will all be named at a later date. Due to the fact that the foundation is still in the process of picking an advisor team, these coins have not been distributed yet and will remain in the @advisors account. Each advisor will receive 1,000,000.0000 RSN.

### VIII. Distribution Overview
Below is an overview of how the distribution is spread out:

**Original Contributors (Refunds)** - ***33.33% (approx 333,250,000 RSN)*** - Approximately 120,000,000.0000 RSN has been distributed on both the BitShares and Arisen networks, while other refunds are going through a specific claims process, which can be found here: [http://claims.arisen.network](http://claims.arisen.network).

**Air Drop (Public Distribution)** - ***30% (exactly 300,000,000 RSN)*** - Exactly 300,000,000 RSN will be distributed via a global air drop. The air drop will be promoted via major cryptocurrency websites, to achieve distribution to 300,000 users. This portion of the distribution will help decentralize the network.

**Project Funding / Other Air Drops (OneCoin, InfiBit and Peeps)** - ***15% (exactly 150,000,000 RSN)*** - Exactly 95,000,000 RSN has been given to four companies (InfiBit, OneCoin, DevGenesis and Peeps), for furthering development on the Arisen platform, as well as for current/future dApp development projects. Peeps' account creation service automatically stakes RSN for NET, CPU and RAM resources on the network when creating accounts, via its sponsored account creation service that can be found [here](https://signup.arisen.network), further distributing the coins that @peeps currently holds to the new users its signup service is currently onboarding.

**Initial Block Producers** - ***15.77% (approx 157,750,000 RSN)*** - Approximately 157,750,000 RSN has already been given to the network's initial 21 block producers. All of these coins are currently staked on the network, which is what allowed for the network to startup in the first place and ultimately decentralize amongst the first 21 nodes. While we picked these block producers, they are also contributors to the project itself and will ultimately keep these coins. We anticipate though, that most of these block producers will remain and will look out for the best interest of the network, due to the time, energy and efforts they have invested into the network itself. 

**Advisors** - ***1.9% (exactly 19,000,000 RSN)*** - Exactly 19,000,000 RSN has been reserved in the @advisors account, so that 1,000,000 RSN can be given to the network/foundation's 19 advisors, all of which will be announced soon.

**Charity** - ***1% (exactly 10,000,000 RSN)*** - Exactly 10,000,000 RSN has been reserved in the @charity account to given out for charitable purposes. Currently 500,000.0000 RSN remains in the @charity account.

**Legal** - ***3% (exactly 30,000,000 RSN)*** - Exactly 30,000,000 RSN has been reserved in the @legal account, all of which has been given to a law firm to handle the legal and regulatory hurdles the foundation and others involved may encounter, while trying to bring the Arisen network to life. 

#### TOTAL: 1,000,000,000 RSN

### X. Roadmap To Decentralization
While there is a concern that some accounts may hold too many coins, like the @air account (for the Arisen air drop), these accounts will soon further decentralize the network through air drops and other means, as explained below in several phases.

#### X.A. - Phase 1 - Arisen Air Drop + Original Contributors
When the Arisen air drop takes place on May 1st, 2020, we will have spread 66% of the RSN in circulation to over 100,000 accounts, including those from the original AriseBank ICO and the @refund account. We will do so by marketing the Arisen air drop via popular cryptocurrency websites like CoinMarketCap, along with several other popular crypto websites and promoting the claim process to original AriseBank contributors, so that we can achieve this goal for the network.

#### X.B. - Phase 2 - Organic Growth
As accounts are created through organic growth, coins have to be staked in a new user's account in order for the account to be created - further decentralizing the network and growing the user base at the same time. Thanks to the many projects being funded by OneCoin, InfiBit and Peeps, we're confident that the network will have enough funding for marketing in order to continue growing organically.

#### X.C. - Phase 3 - Exchange Growth
Once RSN is placed on exchanges, those who are interested in purchasing RSN from current holders can do so easily. Currently, RSN can be purchased via [BitShares](https://wallet.bitshares.org) from current holders. This will also further decentralize the network, as current holders will most certainly sell some of their coins over time to new holders.

#### X.D. - Phase 4 - Inflation
RSN will grow far beyond the 1 billion RSN in its initial supply, via inflation (to a max growth of 10 billion RSN). Through inflation, Arisen's network will further decentralize itself, over a period of well over 150 years.

### XI. Current Distributions
Currently there are 109,677,888.9992 RSN distributed via the BitShares network and the remaining from RSN's total supply will be spread across the Arisen network at the time of the genesis block.

Once the main Arisen network launches, you will begin to see a lot of transactions taking place over the network, as we begin executing this distribution plan.
